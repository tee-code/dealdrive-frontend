This course is project based so we will be using the skills we learn along the way to create some awesome animations.
                            Learn The Art of 3D Animation From The Very Basics to The More Advanced
                            *We will kick it off with learning the VERY basics of Blender. How to navigate around the scene, manipulate objects and everything you need to know to be comfortable in Blender!
                            *Then we will start with our very first animation project! Learning the basics of animation, modeling, materials, shapekeys to animate the face and much more to create our very first animation scene!
                            *Our second animation will be all about curves, animating along curves, using particle systems, modeling, texturing and much more! By this point you will start to feel comfortable with Blender and 3D animation and have the skills and knowledge where you can start doing your own projects!
                            *Our third project is a full blown animation! Just this one alone will teach you everything you need to know about character creation and animation! From making our character to rigging and adding materials to then creating our whole scene, lighting, adding sounds and much more! By the end of this you will have created a full blown animation that looks great and have learned the skills needed to create your own!
                            *Our fourth project leads us to creating a human character! First making the human from scratch to then creating a full body rig that works nicely! In this one we go even more in depth with the node or shader editor and take a look at making different materials such as the eye material, skin shader and cloth material for our character. We will then fully animate this character, see how to make our own sounds and MUCH more!
                            *For our fifth project we will be lip synching and making a character that talks! Firstly we will be modeling and making our alien from scratch! Then adding materials and a rig to fully animate and control him. We will then see how to make a character talk and much more!
                            *Each project we do builds on the previous one and the further you go, the more you will be applying and doing!
                            *End With The Confidence and Know How to Be Able to Create Your Own Projects and Animations From Just An Idea to Finished Product
                            The Power to Create in the Palm of Your Hands
                            *Use the skills you learn to then create your own artwork and animations
                            *Learn and follow along with the workflow of 5 complete animations from A-Z
                            *Finish the course with your very own animations and work of art that you can be proud of
                            *Lifetime access!
                            By the end of this training, you will emerge equipped with everything you need to know about character creation and animation! It is PACKED with character animation
